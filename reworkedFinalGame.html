			<ul class="bodywritting">
				<li>As per zombie life rules you need brains to survie,shots damage you and take away the brains you collected.</li>
				<li>Wait what about the feet you say?</li>
				<li>Don't worry the feet mean you niether eat nor take in damage.</li>
				<li>When you click your brains will be totaled, shots will be totaled as well as the feet.</li>
				<li>These will all be recorded and then shown at the end of each round in the console.</li>
				<li>The shots you collect will be deducted from your total brains and the end result will be how much health you have left over. </li>
				<li>You get 8 total rounds and at the end if you have a level 5 or higher health You win!</li>
				<li>You survive as the brain eating, grunting, human hunting machine that you are.</li>
				<li>But what if at the end of the 8 rounds you have less than a level 5 health you say? That's it!</li>
				<li>You lose and you die the sad painful death of a injured shot-up, starving zombie!</li>
				<li>You will be insulted so beware this game is not for the sensitive!</li>
				<li>Only the most hardend, tough, rough and tumbled luck-filled zombies survive.</li>
				<li>Yes this is a game of pure luck but thats the fun of it right?!?</li>
				<li>Now go on do it.... SURVIVE! Click the button to start.</li>
