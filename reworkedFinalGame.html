		<h1>Zombie Dice</h1>
		<h3> The rules:</h3>
		<p>Welcome to Zombie Dice. The name of the game here folks is to try and survive. Plot twist YOU ARE THE ZOMBIE!<br>
		With every click of the button you will be rolling six dice. On each die there are different amount of Brains, Shots, and Feet.<br>
		At the end of the round after you have seen your totals, hit the clear button to keep that console all nice and tidy will ya?<br>
		So here's the break down.<br>
		As per zombie life rules you need brains to survie, 
		shots damage you and take away the brains you collected.<br>
		Wait what about the feet you say? Don't worry the feet mean you niether eat nor take in damage.<br>
		When you click your brains will be totaled, shots will be totaled as well as the feet.<br>
		These will all be recorded and then shown at the end of each round in the console.<br>
		The shots you collect will be deducted from your total brains and the end result will be how much health you have left over. <br>
		You get 8 total rounds and at the end if you have a level 5 or higher health You win! You survive as the brain eating, grunting, human hunting machine that you are.<br>
		But what if at the end of the 8 rounds you have less than a level 5 health you say? That's it! You lose and you die the sad painful death of a injured shot-up, starving zombie!<br>
		You will be insulted so beware this game is not for the sensitive!<br>
		Only the most hardend, tough, rough and tumbled luck-filled zombies survive.<br>
		Yes this is a game of pure luck but thats the fun of it right?!?<br>
		Now go on do it.... SURVIVE! Click the button to start. </p>
